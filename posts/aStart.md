# Morning Notes

After many a long time I have finally decided to start writing this blog. I am
going to try to make a habit of it, making a nice tea in the morning and
composing first thing at 5:45am.

I want to use it to articulate my thoughts better and maybe straighten them out
somewhat. There are myriad topics I wish to elaborate upon. To name a few:

- An inability to hold friendships and an analysis of the reasoning behind their
  disintegrations.
- An analysis of exactly what it is that causes uncontrollable agitation when
  visiting my parents home.
- An an analysis of my main mistakes to date in life and the lessons to draw
  from them. What, of this, can be discarded.
- A commentary on the current state of the zeitgeist.
- A clearing up of what exactly dissappoints me most about my biological father
  and the enduring effects his upbringing has caused.
- From friend to foe, the Jacob effect.
- A cut from left to right, keeps away the dark of night. Self-destruction - a
  rational explanation.

These while being rather close to the chest are some topics that I hope and
should approach with a degree of lightness. These are also topics upon which my
internal commentary is constantly rolling and thus something which I need to
dump into the digital seas for what I hope to be some form of catharsis.

While this is a non-exhaustive list of issues from the deep which require light
to be shed upon them and of which I am sure I could furnish with examples which
will warrant their own analysis. Isn't it funny that analysis is always spelt
anal-ysis. There are also topics of a more light hearted nature which I wish to
comment upon:

- Jiu-Jitsu, an serious attempt to dissect exactly why anyone would do it over a
  period of time.
- Is it better to avoid the news all together, or allow yourself to enjoy the
  outrage porn that they now sell.
- What would it look like for money to be the ultimate god.

And finally I would like to make a series of analysis on the works by Jordan B
Peterson. I have read his 12 Rules for Life and Beyond Order. Those more
antagonistic to his works attack first the nature of my unreserved subscriptions
to his writings and in a fashion befitting of his works I should listen to this.
Though I largely suspect that such criticism is born out of resentment and dare
I say hatred for the fact that the advice professed may be exactly what would be
necessary to help those who critisize the works, but not desired. Nevertheless
my first order will be to critique as viciously as possible the arguments put
forth by JP. Once a strong case has been made against "_the gospel of JP_", I
shall then task myself with rebutting these, and then rebutting the rebuttals
and iterate over this till a satisfactory depth of analysis has been reached.

Well that's quite enough to be getting on with.
