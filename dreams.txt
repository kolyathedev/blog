- flew into space via a weird uber car. Felt the gravity pulling against me as I vertically shot up in this car. Felt like it was connected to Elon Musk. In the space station, saw Nathan in the Canteen. Felt a bit irksome from the difference in gravity. Asked him why he never said hello sir back to me. Saw Matt Hucker in the corner. Skip forward, a gravitational wave threatens to tear the station in half. Soem kid has an answer and he wishes to provide it in the assembly of people.
